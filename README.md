# fixSpotify
 A tool to clear the cache on Spotify and make it work again.
 
Spotify's desktop app has a tendency for the cache to get overfull
and make the app stop working.  Anytime I hit a frozen app, or delayed play/pause, 
or a failure of the app to load an artist, track, whatever, I just run this .sh script
to clear the app cache.

You'll have to log back in after, but you'll enjoy a smooth listening experience again!


This is specific for the Spotify Desktop app on Mac OS.
